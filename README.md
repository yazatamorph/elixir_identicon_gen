# Identicon Generator

Generates and saves a unique identicon based on input string. Based on a project from Stephen Grider's Elixir course, with a few fixes and improvements.

## Usage

To run the generator, enter `mix start {string}` in your terminal from the project root directory, replacing `{string}` with your own custom input. Your identicon will be saved in the project root as `{string}.png`.
